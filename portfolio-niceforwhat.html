          <p>Ms. Lauryn Hill has not had a radio single in years. Her last album was released in 1998. Big Freedia is a trans-women from New Orleans, famous in the city as the gatekeeper for a style of music called New Orleans Bounce. She has never had an album that has been among the billboard top 100. Yet if anyone listened to pop music radio over the past year, they are guaranteed to have heard both their voices on one of the most popular songs in the country. Ms. Hill's "Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me" and Big Freedia's "I want to know who's m*****f***ing representing in here tonight!" start off a single by Drake, Canadian rapper and world's biggest pop star. In his song Nice For What, Drake uses the voice of both Ms. Hill and Big Freedia to write a celebratory song about powerful women, using the sounds of New Orleans Bounce, Big Freedia's genre. But there is one more important aspect to this song. Lauryn Hill recorded her vocals about 15 years earlier and Big Freedia didn't even know she was on the song at first: They were both used as samples.  Their voices on one of the biggest songs of 2018 was a powerful moment. Hip-hop has an unfortunate history of misogyny and transphobia, so having a woman and a member of the LGBTQ community be key parts in a song hit, especially one that celebrates women so unashamedly, was both rare and rewarding for the community, as it shows that anyone, regardless of background, can make successful music. They both heavily influenced the current soundscape of pop music, and in doing so has made pop music more diverse and open to new ideas, which is always a benefit for a creative field like music.</p>
