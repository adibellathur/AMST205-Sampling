          <p>&emsp;&emsp;Another artist commonly sampled to give thematic depth into music is Nina Simone, popular primarily among hip-hop artists. Politically outspoken artists like Nina Simone, who “actively spoke out against the economic exploitation of black artists while risking her career in the fight for racial equality”, have a unique power when being sampled, allowing the artist to tap into a larger movement and message, something greater than what they could just explain themselves. Her songs have been used by Talib Kweli, a rapper from Chicago who has used Nina Simone’s voice in his own songs, often having political messages themselves. His song “Get By” talks about the struggles of growing up poor and underprivileged. In his own words, the goal of the song is “talkin’ about our situation as black people, as poor people, as oppressed people, uh, and what people do to get by, uh, we’ve, we’ve, we’ve learned how to just get by and survive and we’re not actually living” (http://www.daveyd.com/interviewtalibkweliaol.html note: I am trying to find evidence this interview isn’t made up. It is a known person but I have no references to it yet). And his production matches his message. Produced by Kanye West, the instrumental samples Simone’s voice. Talib Kweli is well aware of the message of Nina Simone’s music, saying In his 2006 essay in Fader magazine's special issue on Simone, Kweli writes, "I relate to Nina Simone because when she came out, they didn't like the way she sounded, yet she made political records and conscious records that really came to represent her."  And the 2 voices interplay to create a story about the generational fight against inequality, one that is ongoing, ins the same way Nina’s voice acts as a muse and guiding spirit in the instrumental over which Kweli speaks his opinions. According to Salamishah Tillet from American Quarterly, “in many ways, sampling's ability to help … transform sound production lies at the heart of hip- hop's own sonic black radicalism.” Sampling is the tool which allows modern pop music/hip-hop to tackle complex themes and tap into a larger collective movement.
